# SamplePlugin


Simple example plugin for Dalamud.

This is not designed to be the simplest possible example, but it is also not designed to cover everything you might want to do. For more detailed questions, come ask in [the Discord](https://discord.gg/holdshift).

## Main Points

* Simple functional plugin
  * Slash command
  * Main UI
  * Settings UI
  * Image loading
  * Plugin json
* Simple, slightly-improved plugin configuration handling
* Project organization
  * Copies all necessary plugin files to the output directory
    * Does not copy dependencies that are provided by dalamud
    * Output directory can be zipped directly and have exactly what is required
  * Hides data files from visual studio to reduce clutter
    * Also allows having data files in different paths than VS would usually allow if done in the IDE directly
